# o8spa
O8SPA is order 8 point side-channel attack on elliptic curve. 
This attack exploit the weakness of Curve25519 on the scalar multiplication algorithm and its implementation with Montgomery ladder. 
This python code is a machine learning algorithm for pattern recognition. It is meant to train a model from SCA traces and analyse other similar attacks. The device used for the attack is ArduinoUNO and traces are power consumption of the microcontroler.
